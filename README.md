# mb-backend
 
To run the backend I use Xampp. Put all the files under htdocs/mb-backend and run the server. The database file is in the /database folder.

Notice: There's currently an issue where data gets submitted and inserted into the database twice - one normal row and one empty row. I couldn't figure out how to fix this issue.
